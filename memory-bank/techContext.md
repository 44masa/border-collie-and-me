## Development Setup

### Local Development Environment

1. **Prerequisites**

   - Node.js (v14+)
   - npm or yarn
   - Modern web browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
   - Git

2. **Project Structure**

   ```
   border-collie-and-me/
   ├── src/                  # Source code
   │   ├── assets/           # Game assets (sprites, audio, etc.)
   │   ├── components/       # UI components
   │   ├── core/             # Core game engine
   │   ├── entities/         # Game entities (sheep, dog, etc.)
   │   ├── systems/          # Game systems (time, economy, etc.)
   │   ├── utils/            # Utility functions
   │   └── index.ts          # Entry point
   ├── public/               # Static files
   ├── tests/                # Test files
   ├── dist/                 # Build output
   ├── webpack.config.js     # Webpack configuration
   ├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
   └── package.json          # Project dependencies and scripts
   ```

3. **Development Workflow**
   - `npm install` - Install dependencies
   - `npm start` - Start development server
   - `npm test` - Run tests
   - `npm run build` - Create production build with Vite
   - `npm run lint` - Run linting

### Deployment Pipeline

1. **Build Process**

   - Vite handles TypeScript transpilation
   - Efficient bundling with rollup under the hood
   - Optimized asset handling
   - Fast builds with esbuild pre-bundling

2. **Testing**

   - Unit tests for core systems
   - Integration tests for system interactions
   - Performance tests for critical paths
   - Browser compatibility tests

3. **Deployment Targets**
   - GitHub Pages for hosting
   - CDN for asset delivery
   - Service workers for offline capability

## Technical Constraints

### Browser Compatibility

1. **Target Browsers**

   - Chrome (latest 2 versions)
   - Firefox (latest 2 versions)
   - Safari (latest 2 versions)
   - Edge (latest version)

2. **Mobile Support**

   - Limited mobile support (primarily tablet)
   - Touch controls as secondary input method
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Target: 60 FPS on mid-range devices
   - Fallback rendering modes for lower-end devices
   - Progressive asset loading for slower connections

### Storage Limitations

1. **LocalStorage**

   - 5MB limit per domain
   - Compression for save data to maximize storage
   - Backup/restore functionality for save data

2. **Asset Management**
   - Efficient sprite atlases to reduce memory usage
   - Audio compression for smaller file sizes
   - On-demand loading for less frequently used assets

### Technical Debt Management

1. **Code Quality Standards**

   - Strict TypeScript configuration
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Regular refactoring sessions

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Runtime performance metrics
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Automated performance regression testing
