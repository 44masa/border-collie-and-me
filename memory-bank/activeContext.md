# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initial planning and prototype phase. We are establishing the foundational documentation and project structure for "Border Collie and Me," a browser-based sheep ranch simulation game. At this stage, the focus is on creating a functional prototype to validate core gameplay mechanics before proceeding with full-scale development.

### Primary Focus Areas

1. **Prototype Development**

   - Creating a playable prototype to test core mechanics
   - Validating the herding gameplay with simple graphics
   - Testing the interaction between player, Border Collie, and sheep

2. **Project Documentation**

   - Creating comprehensive memory bank documentation
   - Establishing project requirements and scope
   - Defining technical architecture and patterns

3. **Conceptual Development**

   - Refining game mechanics and systems
   - Defining core gameplay loops
   - Planning progression systems

4. **Technical Foundation**
   - Determining technology stack and dependencies
   - Planning project structure
   - Establishing development workflows

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial setup of the memory bank, there are no previous changes to document. This file will track changes as the project progresses.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Next 1-2 Weeks)

1. **Project Setup**

   - Initialize project repository
   - Set up development environment
   - Configure build system and tooling

2. **Core Engine Development**

   - Implement basic game loop
   - Create rendering pipeline
   - Develop input handling system
   - Establish entity-component system

3. **Prototype Testing**
   - Create simple prototype of sheep movement
   - Implement basic Border Collie controls
   - Test core herding mechanics
   - Gather feedback on gameplay feel and controls

### Short-Term Goals (Next 1-2 Months)

1. **Core Systems Implementation**

   - Time system with day/night and seasonal cycles
   - Basic ranch management functionality
   - Simple economy system
   - Animal behavior systems

2. **Asset Pipeline**

   - Establish art style guidelines
   - Create initial sprite sheets
   - Implement asset loading and management

3. **Game State Management**
   - Implement save/load functionality
   - Develop state management architecture
   - Create game progression systems

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Under Consideration

1. **Rendering Approach**

   - Evaluating Canvas vs. WebGL for primary rendering
   - Considering performance implications for large numbers of entities
   - Balancing visual quality with performance

2. **State Management Pattern**

   - Evaluating Redux-like patterns vs. simpler state management
   - Considering immutability requirements and performance implications
   - Planning for save/load functionality

3. **Asset Management Strategy**
   - Determining optimal sprite sheet organization
   - Planning progressive loading strategy
   - Considering memory constraints for different devices

### Gameplay Decisions Under Consideration

1. **Control Scheme**

   - Direct control of Border Collie vs. command-based system
   - Keyboard/mouse controls vs. more abstract interface
   - Balancing accessibility with depth

2. **Progression Pacing**

   - Rate of ranch expansion and upgrades
   - Learning curve for Border Collie abilities
   - Economic balance and resource management

3. **Difficulty Scaling**
   - How challenges increase over time
   - Balance between relaxing gameplay and engaging challenges
   - Recovery mechanisms from setbacks

### Open Questions

1. **Scope Considerations**

   - What is the minimum viable product (MVP) feature set?
   - Which features should be prioritized for initial release?
   - What features could be added post-launch?

2. **Technical Constraints**

   - How to ensure performance across different devices?
   - What are the browser compatibility requirements?
   - How to handle offline play and data persistence?

3. **User Experience**
   - How to make the game accessible to casual players?
   - What tutorial systems are needed?
   - How to communicate game mechanics clearly?

## Current Blockers

1. **Resource Allocation**

   - Need to determine development resources and timeline
   - Establish art production pipeline
   - Define testing methodology

2. **Technical Validation**
   - Need to validate performance of core engine concepts
   - Test entity limits for gameplay scenarios
   - Verify save/load approach
