# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Initial Planning and Prototype Development

The "Border Collie and Me" project is currently in the conceptual and prototype development phase. We have established the core concept, gameplay elements, and technical approach, and are now focusing on creating a functional prototype to validate core gameplay mechanics before proceeding with full-scale development.
